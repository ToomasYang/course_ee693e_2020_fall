## Paper Summary
Cellular baseband chips play a crucial role in  smartphone security, which parse large amounts of data before authentication. This brings concerns in security from stealthy attackers who gathers information from smartphones. This paper proposes a novel cellular fuzzing framework which aims to help security researchers find
critical bugs in cellular basebands. These fuzzing tools include a sanitizing drop-in allocator. MediaTek is one of the largest vendors for mobile phone baseband chips. And they chose MediaTek baseband as a target to implement their fuzzing techniques and prove the viability of BaseSAFE.

## Review
### Strengths
- BaseSAFE provides an API which makes it easy to quickly implement fuzz cases without additional overhead
- The drop-in sanitizing allocator finds memory corruption bugs automatically 

### Weaknesses
- This paper assumes that the reader has sufficient amount of background knowledge.
