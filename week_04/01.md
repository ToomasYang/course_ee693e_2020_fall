## Paper Summary
This paper introduces a secure motion verification scheme based on Angle-of-Arrival and Frequency-of-Arrival that only requires a single verifier, by exploiting opportunistic signal refection paths in the environment to create multiple virtual verifiers. Which allows vehicles in a smart transportation system to share motion state information safely and efficiently, while previous approaches are often not efficient that require multiple cooperative distributed verifiers. The authors analyzed their scheme from theoretical point of view with realistic road topology.They also carried out real-world experiments for both static and moving vehicles in a campus enviroment. The results show that their scheme can accurately detect false motion claims in a low relative speed vehicular network.

## Review
### Strengths
The main strengths are as follows
- The paper introduces a novel idea that leverage opportunistic signal refection paths to generate "virtual" verifiers, which singnificantly reduces the cost of previous approaches that depend on multiple verifiers.
- The authors provide a detialed theoretical analysis on their scheme that based on a maximum likelihood estimation of the position and velocity.
- Real-word experiments on constraint environment were performed that verifed their theoretical results.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness are:
- The approach requires an accurate map that records the position and angle of the surface of buildings in the area. Which is critical to perform an accurate estimation on the position and velocity based on the rflected signals.
- The authors only consider one-hop of reflection due to easy of theoretical analysis, and argue that multi-hop reflected signal will have significat lower power. However, it is possible that in an complex environment the influence of multi-hop signals be large enough due to superposition.
- The approach may not work in rural area when there are no enough reflection points.
- The experinments only carry out in an campus environment, it is not clear how the scheme performs in complex envirnment where multiple vehicles involved.
