## Paper Summary
Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) contributes to aircraft traffic control where ADS-B messages contain information about the aircrafts location and tracks to provide better real-time traceability of the aircraft in space. ADS-B consist of two services. ADS-B Out to broadcast data, and ADS-B In to receive data. The interesting point of this protocol is that it is broadcasted with no encryption. And this data includes Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, icao24, time, speed, etc. Basically, this ADS-B information is open to anyone. The main contribution of this paper is classified into three: (1) Propose a design for ADS-B message verification protocol to evaluate the trustworthiness of received messages where "MLAT" is not applicable, (2) Evaluate the proposed protocol with real-world data from "OpenSky" network for attack scenarios, (3) Provide real-world evidence by observations relating to the aviation system in terms of aircraft routes and speed. The porposed architecture, "MAVPro" succeeds the coverage limitation of "MLAT" by increasing the area by verifying messages that are received by three or less ground sensors. MAVPro could be integrated with MLAT to verify the messages where MLAT is not applicable. This would definitely improve the security of ADS-B messages.

## Review
### Strengths
- This paper successfuly demonstrates an improved aproach to existing archicetures in order to secure ADS-B messages. MavPro is shown to cover more area described in percentages around the globe, using less sensors, along with the MLAT aproach. 
- This paper provides real-world measurements by utilizing an open source OpenSky network. The implimentation of this method clearly shows its effects on a real-world global scale. 

### Weaknesses
- This paper does not cover reasons for the open nature of ADS-B messages. This would help for better contex of the paper.  

### Detailed Comments / Audience Questions	
First of all, MLAT is an exisiting method used to determine the location of the aircraft in space. If a message is received by four or more stations with known locations on the ground, they can use the location and the signal reception times (Time Difference of Arrival—TDOA) to find intersection points. However, this requires messages to be received by four or more sensors. Also the accuracy of MLAT decreases over long distances and in noisy environments. In the threat model, the attacker manipulates ADS-B messages and behaves like a legitimate sender, broadcasting messages modify existing traffic. To evaluate the effectiveness of MAVPro, this paper tested how MAVPro deals with the attack scenarios and checks the accuracy of the Location_check algorithm to compute the aircraft coordinates compared to the actual location, then uses this information as a tool to check the trustworthiness of the received message. MAVPro could be integrated with MLAT to verify the messages where MLAT is not applicable.

- L. Brian: One of the authentication methods mention comparing the planes current path to that of the expected, what if the plane purposely strays off track, for example to avoid unexpected turbulence, how does that affect authentication?

[Answer to the questions]

- M. Noha: why MAVPro does not require any changes to the current ADS-B message structure or infrastructure?

[Answer to the questions]

- S. Grant: Can MAVPro be optimized further to increase time complexity from O(logx)?

[Answer to the questions]

- Y. Alvin: Is MAVPro susceptible to attacks from aboard the plane?

[Answer to the questions]

- Y. Dawei: Will it be less secure if the anchors cannot get updated from MLAT for too long?

[Answer to the questions]

- Y. Thomas: Why don't they give every aircraft a security certificate to communicate with, timestamped to prevent replays?

[Answer to the questions]

- Y. Japhet: How does this protocol affect current hardware? (i.e. would the implementation of this protocol on the hardware level greatly increase the cost and complexity of ADS-B hardware)

[Answer to the questions]

- S. Matthew: Do you think machine learning can make this solution more automated or accurate?
