## Paper Summary
Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) contributes to aircraft traffic control where ADS-B messages contain information about the aircrafts location and tracks to provide better real-time traceability of the aircraft in space. ADS-B consist of two services. ADS-B Out to broadcast data, and ADS-B In to receive data. The interesting point of this protocol is that it is broadcasted with no encryption. And this data includes Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, icao24, time, speed, etc. Basically, this ADS-B information is open to anyone. The main contribution of this paper is classified into three: (1) Propose a design for ADS-B message verification protocol to evaluate the trustworthiness of received messages where "MLAT" is not applicable, (2) Evaluate the proposed protocol with real-world data from "OpenSky" network for attack scenarios, (3) Provide real-world evidence by observations relating to the aviation system in terms of aircraft routes and speed. The porposed architecture, "MAVPro" succeeds the coverage limitation of "MLAT" by increasing the area by verifying messages that are received by three or less ground sensors. MAVPro could be integrated with MLAT to verify the messages where MLAT is not applicable. This would definitely improve the security of ADS-B messages.

## Review
### Strengths
- This paper successfuly demonstrates an improved aproach to existing archicetures in order to secure ADS-B messages. MavPro is shown to cover more area described in percentages around the globe, using less sensors, along with the MLAT aproach. 
- This paper provides real-world measurements by utilizing an open source OpenSky network. The implimentation of this method clearly shows its effects on a real-world global scale. 

### Weaknesses
- This paper does not cover reasons for the open nature of ADS-B messages. This would help for better contex of the paper.  

### Detailed Comments / Audience Questions	
First of all, MLAT is an exisiting method used to determine the location of the aircraft in space. If a message is received by four or more stations with known locations on the ground, they can use the location and the signal reception times (Time Difference of Arrival—TDOA) to find intersection points. However, this requires messages to be received by four or more sensors. Also the accuracy of MLAT decreases over long distances and in noisy environments. In the threat model, the attacker manipulates ADS-B messages and behaves like a legitimate sender, broadcasting messages modify existing traffic. To evaluate the effectiveness of MAVPro, this paper tested how MAVPro deals with the attack scenarios and checks the accuracy of the Location_check algorithm to compute the aircraft coordinates compared to the actual location, then uses this information as a tool to check the trustworthiness of the received message. MAVPro could be integrated with MLAT to verify the messages where MLAT is not applicable.

- L. Brian: One of the authentication methods mention comparing the planes current path to that of the expected, what if the plane purposely strays off track, for example to avoid unexpected turbulence, how does that affect authentication?

If the plane purposely strays off track (e.g. to avoid unexpected turbulence) , the path of the plane is still recorded within the ADS-B protocol. Therefore, there is no affect to the authentication protocol.


- M. Noha: why MAVPro does not require any changes to the current ADS-B message structure or infrastructure?

The ground sensors, and exististing radar systems are built for ADS-B authentication. MAVPro does not require any more infrastructure used in its algorthm. The algorthm utilizes tracks and destications to build a matrix for its path. Therefore, there is no need for more structures. 

- S. Grant: Can MAVPro be optimized further to increase time complexity from O(logx)?

x is the represented as the array dimension. O(logx) can be opitmized to create a binary search for the matrix used in the MAVPro Protocol. This would satisfy the time complexity in order to meet real-time requirements.

- Y. Alvin: Is MAVPro susceptible to attacks from aboard the plane?

If an attacker can broadcast a constant message from the plane, MAVPro will still be able to verify the location through triangulation using MLAT.

- Y. Dawei: Will it be less secure if the anchors cannot get updated from MLAT for too long?

When anchors are not updated and is far away from the true anchor point, the prediction of the location will begin to stray away from the actual location. Therefore, it is not secure.

- Y. Thomas: Why don't they give every aircraft a security certificate to communicate with, timestamped to prevent replays?

First of all, ADS-B messages are not encrypted. The reason why is because it was a design flaw made at the begining of the architecture. Now, it is very costly to install hardware to every planes Transmitter, Receiver, and decoder who uses ADS-B messages. Also, this must comply with all countries who's planes utilize ADS-B messages.

- Y. Japhet: How does this protocol affect current hardware? (i.e. would the implementation of this protocol on the hardware level greatly increase the cost and complexity of ADS-B hardware)

MAVPro will be direclty implemented to the Air Traffic Control stations, not the planes themselves. Therefore, no additional hardware is needed, with minimal complexity in software.

- S. Matthew: Do you think machine learning can make this solution more automated or accurate?

Machine learning can possibly be used in the prediction method. However, machine learning can be manipulated by external data points such as data polution, malicious data. This may cause a possibility to affect the location check algorithm negatively. It can be a risk using machine learning in this case.
