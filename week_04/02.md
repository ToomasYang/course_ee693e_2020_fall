### Detailed Comments / Audience Questions	
[PROVIDE DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES LISTED ABOVE (>
200 WORDS)]
- L. Brian: One of the authentication methods mention comparing the planes current path to that of the expected, what if the plane purposely strays off track, for example to avoid unexpected turbulence, how does that affect authentication?
[Answer to the questions]

- M. Noha: why MAVPro does not require any changes to the current ADS-B message structure or infrastructure?
[Answer to the questions]

- S. Grant: Can MAVPro be optimized further to increase time complexity from O(logx)?
[Answer to the questions]

- Y. Alvin: Is MAVPro susceptible to attacks from aboard the plane?
[Answer to the questions]

- Y. Dawei: Will it be less secure if the anchors cannot get updated from MLAT for too long?
[Answer to the questions]

- Y. Thomas: Why don't they give every aircraft a security certificate to communicate with, timestamped to prevent replays?
[Answer to the questions]

- Y. Japhet: How does this protocol affect current hardware? (i.e. would the implementation of this protocol on the hardware level greatly increase the cost and complexity of ADS-B hardware)
[Answer to the questions]

- S. Matthew: Do you think machine learning can make this solution more automated or accurate?
[Answer to the questions]
