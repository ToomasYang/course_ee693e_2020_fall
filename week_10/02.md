[DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCES AND CAUSES BETWEEN RESULTS, IF ANY]


### Questions from Audience
(1) How would a directional antenna differ from an omni-directional antenna to detect movements? Any change in strategy and accuracy?

For omni-directional transmitter the attacker can measure the RSS from all transmitters, while for directional transmitters the attacker can only measre the RSS from certain region. In that sense, a directional transmitter would be more secure and harder to detect the movement.

(2) How much movement do you have to hide before you can say privay has been kept

This paper does not provide a measure to quantify the actual privacy (which can only be qualitative read from the utility function). This can be a direction for future research.

(3) If a transmitter is turned of how can the attacker detect movement using the signals from that transmitter?

If the transmitter is turned off, the attacker will not be able to detect the movement.

(4) Would an attacker be able to utilize machine learning to bypass this defense (assuming they somehow got training data)?

It is possible that machine learning can be help to improve the detection accuracy. However, this is really a ultility-security trade-off, since the defender can also adjust the strategy of switching off transmitters to counter the effect.

(5) the attackers can place mutiple receivers around, is it possible for them to classify a drop in RSS is due to an obstacle or a transmitter is turned off?

Yes, for omni-directional transmitters, an obstacle can often block one direction of the signal while the other receivers can still receve the signal. For directional transmitter, it will be hard to distinguish.

(6) How does location accuracy scale with number of trasmitters/receivers?

As shown in their result, the payoff will increase as more recivers used by the attacker. However, there is a threshold, above which more recievers will not help incrasing the accuracy any more.

(7) Is the security location vulnerability come from the manufacturer side or an inherint flaw with how devices connect to a wireless network?

It is coming from the physical nature of electromagnetic wave.

(8) What types of situations do you see this method implemented? In typical wireless networks in buildings? Or only in specific cases/areas that require more secure connections?

The method could be implemented in government or milittary buildings where security and privacy are of high priority. For other situiation, the privacy gain is actually very limited compare to the ultility loss.
