## Paper Summary
This paper study the problem of protecting location privacy of mobile users when the serice provider is not trusted. The authors proposed a security protocol named Zipphone. Basicly, the protocol tries to assign random pseudonyms to the users that are shared within a community, so that the provider is hard to link the pseudonyms with each individual users. To achive this, the paper introduces a mechanism of refreshing the pseudonymsthat minimizes the trajectory linking while keep the utility in an acceptable level. To analyze their protocol, the authors introduces two notions of user behaviours: predictability and mixing. Based on this, the authors performed evelautes on public datasets with users grouped according to their predicabity and mixing.

## Review
### Strengths
The strenths are as follows
- The protocol do not rely on the coorperation of the service provider. While previous works often have such a requirement.
- The authors evaluated a deanonymization attack that uses a combination of location profiling and trajectory linking, and showed that it is effective in identifying long-term
pseudonyms.
- The authors use two separate datasets of call detail records to evaluate the protocol, and demonstrated that a Zipphone user can defend against the deanonymization attacks by renewing her identifier regularly. 
- The paper also evaluated the utility cost in terms of time offline and battery life, and showed it to be minimal

### Weaknesses
The weaknesses are as follows:
- In order to keep anonymity, the community need a large number of users to share the identites.
- The credntial need to be purchases anonymity, which is not practical.
- The protocol reuqire phone that support software SIM.
- Uers would never be able to quantify their privacy gains as there is no way to determine the number of other Zipphone users.
- The protocol can not prevent physical attacks, e.g. radio frequency fingerprinting.
- The evaluation is limited, since the attackers can use additional informations (e.g. time of day or favourite locations) and uses more advanced classifier.
