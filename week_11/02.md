## Paper Summary
  With the increased usage of Internet of Things (IoT) Devices, security concerns start to rise. One such example of security concerns brought up is with WiFi, BLE, and Zigbee devices that are connected together and used in a home or office setting. Physically placing a sniffer within a IoT network and using it to gather information, a multi-stage privacy attack is designed. The attack is made under the assumption that the sniffer would not be able to directly intercept or read the data that is being transmitted within this IoT network, as it will be under encryption. Instead, the sniffer will look at the characteristics of the transmitted data and use machine learning to make inferences on what each of the devices are doing. With this information, the goal is to inference what a person's actions are. The results of such an attack is shown by the paper, and can be seen to breach a personâ€™s privacy with the tested WiFi, BLE, and Zigbee devices with over 90% accuracy in most cases.

### Audience QUestions
Smart devices work dependently to provide better user experience whithin a network. How would injecting false packets affect devices that work together? Also, are these devices currently updated in order to mitigate such attacks?


-Can a different algorithm be implemented to increase accuracy against false data injection?

-How would the false data injection affect user experience?

-As more different kinds of smart devices are introduced, would it make this identification method more or less effective?

-will the false data affect other devices? if it does, can attackers exploit this to identify a false event?

-Can you explain further how spoofed data works? To blend in well with the other packets, it would need the same legitimate reciever IP, how does the reciever know its a spoofed packet?

-What would be the effect of random packet transmission do to the accuracy of classifing packets?

-Do you know how network transmission errors (i.e. malformed packets, retransmissions) are handled in the datasets? Are the filtered out before they are fed into the ML classifier?
